Different types of annealing are discussed here.

[Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(materials_science) is a heat process that changes the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable. It involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for an appropriate amount of time and then cooling.

In the context of semiconductor manufacturing, it is generally used for recrystallizing the silicon lattice after it is altered by the ion implantation process if such process is done by other means than reactive ion etching.
